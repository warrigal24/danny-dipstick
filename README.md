# Danny Dipstick

By Garry Francis

## Background

You're Danny Dipstick, the sociable single. The only trouble is that all the girls hate you because you're a dork. Every Saturday night you go to the local nightclub and every time you strike out and end up going home alone.

Tonight is going to be different. After picking up some advice from your neighbour, you vow that tonight is the night that you will meet a nice girl and get her phone number. After that, who knows?

As you stand outside the front lobby of the nightclub, you can't help thinking that you've forgotten something...

This is a traditional text adventure that was written for [ParserComp 2021](https://itch.io/jam/parsercomp-2021), 30 April 2021 to 30 June 2021. The game is hosted at [Danny Dipstick](https://warrigal.itch.io/danny-dipstick).
