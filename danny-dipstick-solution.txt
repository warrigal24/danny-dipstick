Solution by Garry Francis
----------------------------------------
This is a minimal solution. You'll need to EXAMINE lots of things for this solution to make sense. Your ultimate goal is to get a girl's phone number, but you also have three sub-goals. You earn 1 point for each goal achieved. The score is indicated in parentheses as (+A=B), where A is points earned and B is cumulative points earned.

(I) (you're wearing a suit & carrying a hand-written note)
(X SUIT) (it's daggy)
(X NOTE) (this is the note your neighbour wrote for you)
(READ IT) (you need to fix three things about you to pick up chicks)
(STATUS) (you have bad breath, dorky clothes and poor social skills)
N
W
(X TABLE) (it has an ashtray)
(X ASHTRAY) (it contains a cigarette butt)
(GET BUTT) (you drop it and it rolls under the table)

(X SIGN) (there's something printed on it)

GIVE TICKET TO CLERK (or REDEEM TICKET, you win $100)
(X RACK) (there's a big gap under it)
(X GAP) you'll have to look under the rack to see what's in the gap)
LOOK UNDER RACK (you find a credit card)
GET CARD
(X IT) (it has owner's details embossed on it)
READ IT (it belongs to Amelia Dickinson)
(LOOK UNDER RACK) (you find dust and dirt and a dead cockroach)
(X DUST) (you're allergic to dust & cockroaches are allergic to you)
W
N
W
(X COLLECTOR) (he has candies)
(TALK TO HIM) (donations of $5 or more get a box of mints, that could be useful)

(ASK VENDOR ABOUT ROSE) (you can ask him about various other things, as well)
BUY ROSE (you acquire a long-stemmed rose for $2)
(X IT) (it's a symbol of love)
N
E
TALK TO GIRL IN GREEN (her name's Janine and she's lost her diamond ring)
GIVE RING TO JANINE (+1=3) (her boyfriend coaches you about class and manners)
